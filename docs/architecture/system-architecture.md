# System Architecture

## Target Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

### Architectural Layers

#### Presentation Layer
- **Components**: Blazor Server Components, Pages, Layouts
- **Responsibilities**: User interface rendering, user interaction handling
- **Technology**: Blazor Server with MudBlazor UI components
- **Features**: Interactive UI components, real-time updates via SignalR

#### Application Layer
- **Components**: Services, State Management, Authentication
- **Responsibilities**: Application logic coordination, use case orchestration
- **Technology**: .NET 8 services with dependency injection
- **Features**: Business workflow coordination, authentication management

#### Domain Layer
- **Components**: Models, Business Logic, Interfaces
- **Responsibilities**: Core business rules, entity definitions, domain logic
- **Technology**: Pure .NET classes and interfaces
- **Features**: Business rule enforcement, domain model integrity

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Components**: Data Stores, External Services
- **Responsibilities**: Data persistence, external system integration
- **Technology**: In-memory data stores (prepared for Entity Framework Core)
- **Features**: Thread-safe data access, repository implementations

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
- **Purpose**: Abstraction layer for data access
- **Implementation**: Generic repository interfaces with concrete implementations
- **Benefits**: Testability, maintainability, future database integration readiness
- **Features**: Async/sync methods, search capabilities, thread-safe operations

### Dependency Injection
- **Scope Management**: Appropriate service lifetimes (Singleton/Scoped/Transient)
- **Service Registration**: Clean separation of concerns through DI container
- **Testing Support**: Easy mocking and unit testing through interface injection
- **Configuration**: Centralized service configuration in Program.cs

### MVVM-like Pattern
- **View Models**: Blazor components act as view models
- **Data Binding**: Two-way data binding with MudBlazor components
- **State Management**: Component-level and application-level state management
- **Event Handling**: Clean event handling through component methods

## Data Architecture

### In-Memory Data Store
- **Thread Safety**: ConcurrentDictionary and SemaphoreSlim for thread-safe operations
- **Performance**: High-performance in-memory operations for demo purposes
- **Scalability**: Designed for easy transition to database systems
- **Data Integrity**: Validation and constraint enforcement at repository level

### Data Flow
1. **User Interaction** → Blazor Component
2. **Component** → Application Service
3. **Service** → Repository Interface
4. **Repository** → Data Store
5. **Response** ← Back through layers
6. **UI Update** ← Real-time updates via SignalR

## Security Architecture

### Authentication System
- **Strategy**: In-memory authentication optimized for Blazor Server
- **Session Management**: Static global state for demo environment
- **SignalR Compatibility**: Authentication state synchronized with SignalR connections
- **State Synchronization**: Navigation-based authentication state refresh

### Authorization Strategy
- **Current**: Basic role-based access (admin/user)
- **Future**: Granular permission system
- **Implementation**: Attribute-based authorization on components and methods

## Performance Architecture

### Blazor Server Optimization
- **Render Mode**: InteractiveServerRenderMode for optimal performance
- **SignalR**: Efficient real-time communication between client and server
- **State Management**: Minimal state transfer and efficient updates
- **Component Design**: Lightweight components with focused responsibilities

### Caching Strategy
- **In-Memory Caching**: Static data caching for frequently accessed information
- **Component State**: Efficient component state management
- **Future**: Redis or distributed caching for production scenarios

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Preparation
- **Stateless Services**: Services designed for stateless operation
- **External State**: Authentication and session state externalization ready
- **Load Balancing**: Architecture supports load balancer deployment

### Database Integration Readiness
- **Repository Abstraction**: Database-agnostic repository interfaces
- **Entity Framework Core**: Architecture prepared for EF Core integration
- **Migration Strategy**: Smooth transition from in-memory to persistent storage

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Architecture
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent logging throughout application layers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ready for APM integration

### Health Checks
- **System Health**: Application health monitoring capabilities
- **Dependency Checks**: External service dependency validation
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance metrics collection ready
