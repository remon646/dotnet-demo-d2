# Publish application
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration
```json
// appsettings.Staging.json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Environment": "Staging"
}
```

#### 3. Deployment Commands
```bash
# Copy published files to staging server
scp -r ./publish/* user@staging-server:/path/to/application/

# On staging server, run application
dotnet EmployeeManagement.dll --environment Staging
```

### Staging Verification

- [ ] All features function correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security configurations active
- [ ] Logging working properly

## Production Deployment

### Production Build Process

#### 1. Final Build Preparation
```bash
# Ensure latest code
git pull origin main

# Clean previous builds
dotnet clean

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build in Release mode
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-debug
```

#### 2. Production Publishing
```bash
# Self-contained deployment (recommended)
dotnet publish --configuration Release \
               --runtime win-x64 \
               --self-contained true \
               --output ./publish-prod

# Framework-dependent deployment (alternative)

               --output ./publish-prod-framework
```

#### 3. Production Configuration
```json
// appsettings.Production.json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "System": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Environment": "Production"
}
```

### Production Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Kestrel Direct Deployment
```bash
# Copy files to production server
scp -r ./publish-prod/* user@prod-server:/opt/employeemanagement/

# On production server
cd /opt/employeemanagement
dotnet EmployeeManagement.dll --environment Production

# Or for self-contained
./EmployeeManagement --environment Production
```

#### Option 2: IIS Deployment (Windows)
1. **Prepare IIS**:
   - Install .NET 8 Hosting Bundle
   - Create application pool
   - Configure application directory

2. **Deploy Files**:
   - Copy published files to IIS directory
   - Configure web.config (auto-generated)
   - Set appropriate permissions

3. **IIS Configuration**:
   ```xml
   <!-- web.config -->
   <configuration>
     <system.webServer>
       <handlers>
         <add name="aspNetCore" path="*" verb="*" 
              modules="AspNetCoreModuleV2" 
              resourceType="Unspecified" />
       </handlers>
       <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" 
                   arguments=".\EmployeeManagement.dll" 
                   stdoutLogEnabled="false" 
                   stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />
     </system.webServer>
   </configuration>
   ```

#### Option 3: Linux Systemd Service
1. **Create Service File**:
   ```ini
   # /etc/systemd/system/employeemanagement.service
   [Unit]
   Description=Employee Management Application
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=notify
   ExecStart=/opt/employeemanagement/EmployeeManagement
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10
   KillSignal=SIGINT
   SyslogIdentifier=employeemanagement
   User=www-data
   Environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. **Enable and Start Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable employeemanagement.service
   sudo systemctl start employeemanagement.service
   sudo systemctl status employeemanagement.service
   ```

### Production Environment Verification

#### Health Checks
```bash
# Check application status
curl -f http://localhost:5000/ || echo "Application not responding"

# Check specific endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:5000/login
curl -f http://localhost:5000/health (if implemented)
```
